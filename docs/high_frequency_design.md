# High Frequency Autoscaling Design

## Background

The Fast Autoscaler project incorporates design concepts inspired by approaches to high-frequency serverless processing. This document outlines how these concepts relate to our autoscaling implementation and potential future enhancements.

## Current Implementation

Our current implementation uses a direct Lambda-based approach that's triggered at regular intervals to make scaling decisions based on queue metrics. This model is effective for standard autoscaling needs where scaling decisions every 1-2 minutes are sufficient.

The autoscaler runs on a fixed schedule (typically every minute) and makes scaling decisions based on:

1. Current queue depth (visible messages)
2. In-flight messages (when configured)
3. Current ECS task count
4. Historical scaling actions (stored in S3)

## Alternative Approaches

### Step Functions Approach

An alternative architecture that could provide more precise timing for scaling decisions would use AWS Step Functions, similar to the approach described by Zac Charles. This approach would involve:

1. An EventBridge rule triggering a Step Function workflow every minute
2. The Step Function executing a series of timed waits (e.g., every 10 seconds)
3. After each wait, invoking the autoscaler Lambda to evaluate and potentially execute scaling decisions

This approach could provide more granular scaling response times, potentially allowing the system to react to queue depth changes faster than the current implementation.

### Lambda + SQS Polling

Another approach would use:

1. A "scheduler" Lambda triggered by EventBridge every minute
2. This Lambda pushing multiple delayed messages to an SQS queue (e.g., 6 messages with delays of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds)
3. A separate "scaling decision" Lambda receiving these messages and executing scaling logic

This approach provides second-level precision similar to the Step Functions approach but may offer better cost efficiency for high-frequency processing.

## Considerations for Implementation

When choosing between these approaches, consider:

1. **Precision needs**: How quickly must the system respond to queue depth changes?
2. **Cost efficiency**: For high-frequency invocations, the Lambda+SQS approach is typically more cost-effective than Step Functions
3. **Operational complexity**: The Step Functions approach may be easier to understand and troubleshoot
4. **Execution guarantees**: Step Functions provides better execution guarantees and visibility into the execution flow

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to our autoscaling implementation include:

1. **Multi-tier scaling**: Using different frequencies for different tiers of response (e.g., checking every minute for standard scaling, but invoking an "emergency scale-up" every 10 seconds if queue depth exceeds critical thresholds)

2. **Predictive scaling**: Combining scheduled scaling with reactive scaling based on machine learning predictions of load patterns

3. **Event-driven scaling**: Instead of periodic checks, implementing direct event-driven scaling based on CloudWatch Alarms or SQS queue metrics

4. **Hybrid approach**: Using a mix of time-based and event-driven scaling to balance responsiveness with efficiency

## Conclusion

While our current implementation is designed for standard autoscaling needs, the architecture is flexible enough to adopt more advanced approaches as requirements evolve. By maintaining a clean separation between the scaling decision logic and the execution mechanism, we can adapt to different timing strategies without fundamental changes to the core autoscaling algorithm.
